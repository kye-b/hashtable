# hashtable
Assignment 7
In this assignment there are 2 different hashtables, one hashtable handles collision by overwriting the old key value pair with the new key value pair.
he second hashtable is smartHash and it handles collision by using chaining. The buckets are essentially linked lists and when one key value pair has the same hash key as another
instead of overwriting the old one, the new one is simply appended to the same bucket. I have created tests for each function and have included my design as a pdf titled Hashtable.
I have added extensive comments to the code in order to explain thoughts behind each decision.
